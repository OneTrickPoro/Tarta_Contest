# What is this?
This is an old script I created to randomly select a particular student for oral quizzes, exercise solving, or similar classroom activities.

# Is it well-written code?
Absolutely not. It has been modified countless times over the years, and it's neither elegant nor efficient.  
However, it works â€” and for my specific needs, that's enough.

# Can I use the script?
Of course! There are just two conditions:
- Do not charge anyone to use it.
- Do not use it for gambling or any other non-educational purposes.
